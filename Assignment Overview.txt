Assignment Overview
The document outlines a home assignment for Tavily, whose goal is to provide agents with relevant web information quickly. The system is designed to balance three specific trade-offs: latency, accuracy, and cost.

Task Description
The objective is to explore different web content summarization strategies while considering the three measurements mentioned above. You are required to develop two distinct strategies:


Fast: Characterized by low latency and moderate quality.


Advanced: Characterized by moderate latency and high quality.

A dataset consisting of 1,000 URLs, their content, and baseline summaries is provided for this task.

Deliverables
The assignment requires two main components:

GitHub Repository (or Notebooks):

Implementation of the summarization strategies.

A benchmark comparison of the approaches using relevant metrics.

One-Pager PDF:

An outline of the research and experimentation process.

Descriptions of the attempted approaches.

A highlight of faced challenges or limitations.

Requirements & Evaluation

Multilingual Support: All approaches must be multilingual.


Length Constraint: Summaries must not exceed 1,500 characters.


Timeline: The due date is one week from the assignment start.


Evaluation Criteria: Performance of the algorithms, justification of chosen metrics, and the feasibility of the solution in a production environment handling millions of daily requests
