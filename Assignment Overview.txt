Summary Assignment
Tavily’s purpose is to provide agents with the most relevant information from the web at speed.
Our system will always balance among 3 trade-offs - latency, accuracy, and cost. In this
assignment, you’ll explore different ways of summarizing web content, while keeping in mind the
three measurements.
Your task is to create two summarization strategies as follows:
1. Fast: low latency, moderate quality.
2. Advanced: moderate latency, high quality.
You are provided with a dataset of 1k URLs, their corresponding content, and summaries
produced by a baseline summarization algorithm.
Deliverables
1. GitHub repo (can also be notebooks):
a. Implement the two summarization strategies.
b. A benchmark comparing the approaches using relevant metrics.
2. One pager PDF:
a. Outline your research and experimentation process.
b. Describe the approaches you tried.
c. Highlight limitations or challenges you faced.
Requirements
1. Approaches must be multilingual.
2. Summary should not exceed 1.5k chars.
Evaluation Criteria
You will be evaluated on:
1. Algorithms performances.
2. Choice and justification of evaluation metrics.
3. Production feasibility (remember Tavily handles millions of requests a day).
Please use your loaded credit card for all purchases needed.
